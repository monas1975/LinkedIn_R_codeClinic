Description: Support data and tools for the sixth and final problem 
    of the Code Clinic Series.
        In this challenge, we are asking our authors to create a 
    dashboard that represents the status of a fictional manufacturing 
    process. The status is contained in a text file with a days 
    worth of observations, one per second. Each observation includes 
    a time stamp and the status of several processes at that time. 
    The challenge to our authors is to create a dashboard that 
    shows the status of each process at the current simulated time. 
    For example: at 4 pm local time, the dashboard should show the 
    values in the data set corresponding to 16:00:00.
        For extra credit, we also supply a list of functions 
    that affect some of the processes. Authors can choose to 
    allow for interactive control of those values. For example, 
    one variable is a sawtooth wave with an inversion point. 
    The value increases in a linear ramp, when it reaches the 
    inversion point, it decreases on a linear ramp.
        Authors could choose to allow for experimentation with 
    the value of limitY, showing the result in the graph.
